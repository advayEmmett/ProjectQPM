# 📘 Question Paper Maker (ProjectQPM)

**Question Paper Maker** is an Android application built using **Kotlin** and **XML** that helps teachers, students, and educators easily **create formatted question papers** — no need for Microsoft Word or complex editors.  
It allows users to dynamically generate and customize question papers with various question types (MCQs, short answers, long answers, etc.) directly on their phone.

## 💬 Why I Built This

As a student, I noticed teachers often struggled with formatting question papers manually in Word.  
This app automates that — it’s fast, lightweight, and focused purely on question paper creation.

---

## 📦 Future Plans

- Add support for **images and diagrams**.
- Export directly to **PDF** and **DOCX**.
- Cloud save and share functionality.
- Templates for different exam types (Objective / Descriptive).
- Theme customization and dark mode improvements.
